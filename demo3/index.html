New opportunities bring new challenges; now, having all that laptops,
smartphones and tablets on WiFi/3G, we need handover (aka <a
    href='https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/continuity/'>continuity</a>),
real time sync and <a href='http://alistapart.com/article/offline-first'>offline work</a>.
Those requirements stressed classic request-response HTTP
architectures leading to
<a href='http://memcached.org/'>fix</a>-on-a-<a
    href='http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-real-time-with-pusher--net-22106'>fix</a>
stacks that are far from
perfection.

Our dream is to develop distributed applications like good old local
MVC apps, by fully delegating the data caching/synchronization magic
to a dedicated layer.  We want to deal with the data uniformly,
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking'>no matter
where it resides</a>.

<!--that still can't fully exploit new HTML5 features such as
WebSocket or
WebStorage.-->

<!--Several kinds of server-side and client-side storage, APIs, event pushers, you name it.-->

We believe, that CRDT is the only approach that allows to fully embrace
the reality of distributed data.
Swarm is a CRDT-based replicated model library (M of MVC) that keeps
your data correctly cached and synchronized in real time using any
storage and transport available.

            <!-- PROBLEM -->
            <p>The problem of data synchronization is indeed purely
            technical with no direct relation to the business
            logic.
            Still, data sync becomes an issue in a complex web app.
            It is still a major challenge to implement real-time sync,
            intermittent connectivity support and caching.
            Very soon, you will find yourself on the toughest
            pages of a CS textbook (see AP of
            <a href='http://blog.foundationdb.com/minimal-explanation-of-the-cap-theorem'>CAP</a>).

            <!--TREND
            distributed logic, ditributed data
            phones multicore  more storage space than
            new opportunities old architectures can't exploit.-->

            </p>

            <!-- DREAM -->
            <p>

            Our vision is to make distributed collaborative apps
            with the same ease we did good old local
            <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller'>MVC</a>
            apps.
            We achieve that by enhancing the classic MVC architecture
            with Replicated Model (M+VC) that embeds all the
            synchronization/caching magic.

            <!--Essentially, that is middleware that keeps in sync
            all the model's replicas.-->

            Once we isolate all the replication inside the model,
            the rest of the MVC loop may make no distinction in processing
            either local or remote events.

            Consequently, by defining both presentation and logic
            over a local replica of the model we achieve perfect compartmentalization.

            The transition from MVC+API to M+VC is
            somewhat comparable to a typical
            <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a> &rarr;
            <a href='http://backbonejs.org'>Backbone</a>
            transition in regard to the degree it sorts things out.
            Instead of endlessly juggling
            caches, local copies, APIs calls and db accesses,
            developers may now concentrate on logic and presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
            Well, but teaching the model to replicate and synchronize
            "on its own" is a major challenge.
            Indeed, replicas must be able to function semi-autonomously,
            as any locking or blocking nixes both usability and
            performance in a distributed system.

            <!--fully isolate fluid data
            to make the system scale  behavior
            non-blocking
             accepting  eventual delivery
            data will be delivered
              rej? reconciliated merged lockless (impractical)-->

            Mathematically, the most bulletproof approach to
            the problem was
            <a href='http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Marc.Shapiro/papers/RR-6956.pdf'>Commutative Replicated Data Types</a>
            <a href='http://kellabyte.com/2013/05/20/convergent-replicated-data-types/'>(CRDT)</a>.
            The CRDT theory is a dramatic improvement on Operational
            Transformation in handling concurrent changes in
            near-real-time systems.
            CRDT tolerates divergence of replicas and varying operation orders,
            aiming to reconciliate changes eventually, once
            all the writes spread to all the replicas.
            CRDT is fundamentally asynchronous, survives intermittent
            connectivity and perfectly matches
            <a href='http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/'>reactive architectures</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Our other goal is a smooth scaling path.
            <!--Once logic and presentation are clearly defined and nicely contained
            in thier respective blocks, scaling is achieved by plugging the
            right data source.-->
            If both logic and presentation are neatly compartmentalized,
            then deployment options may vary without much of disruption.
            That "deployment" stage slows down development way too often!
            A developer should be able to start developing an app
            using Chrome as an IDE and
            local storage as a backend, then switch to SaaS and later on to
            a separate backend cluster.
            That should not be a one-way road: the ability to debug a large app
            piece by piece locally is priceless!
            </p>

            <p>
            Again, our method is to orthogonalize data delivery, logic and
            presentation: define the logic over a local replica, save and sync the
            replica in the background.
            This Replicated Model approach is like Dropbox for your objects.
            </p>

            <p>
            On the engineering side, our mission was to design a minimal
            CRDT basis to implement a lightweight Backbone-like
            framework on top of it.

            Swarm employs a
            <a href='http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/crdtOpsMiddleware.pdf'>pure op-based flavor of CRDT</a>, where
            an object is essentially a stream of mutation events (ops).
            Based on those <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set'>partially ordered</a> <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps'>Lamport-timestamped</a> operation logs, Swarm implements CRDT data types.

          <!--(Differently from classic replication techniques,
          there is no op log linearization. Differently from OT,
          operations are immutable.)

          The foundation is a polog
          reactive at its core
          Triple-mode exchange: state, diff, op.-->

            Swarm operations are represented as key-value pairs where
            the key is a
            <a href='http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/~victor/polo.pdf'>"specifier"</a>,
            a compound id consisting of class, object id,
            Lamport timestamp and operation name. The value is arbitrary JSON.
            All the operation routing, ordering, storage and application
            is based on specifiers.

            <!-- DETAILS -->
            <p>
            Speaking of Swarm API, the best option at this moment is to
            learn by example and by reading
            <a href='/lib/swarm3.js'>the code</a>.
            Swarm implements M of MVC, so key classes are:

            <ul class='classes'>
            <li><tt>Model</tt> is a Backbone-like synced JavaScript object
                (extends Syncable).
            <li><tt>Set</tt> is the Swarm primary collection type (extends Syncable).
            Differently from Backbone, that is not an array, because arrays
            behave poorly under concurrent edits. Still, a Set can be sorted.
            <li><tt>Syncable</tt> is an abstract base class that implements most
            of op(log)
            related logic. A Syncable is an abstract object that is "synced".
            Syncables have a number of hidden fields, _version and _id being the
            most important. The _oplog field contains some of the applied operations;
            which and how many depends on implementation (e.g. see
            <a href='http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction'>log
            compaction</a> discussion by Kreps).
            <li><tt>Host</tt> is (practically) a user session, and (formally) a partial
            replica of a dataset. Normally, a Host has some Storage and one or more
            Pipes to other Hosts.
            <li><tt>Storage</tt> is (formally) a replica that does not implement
            the logic. Practically, that is some storage :)
            Normally, Storage implementations use some dual state+log scheme to
            persist replicas.
            <a href='../../lib/swarm3-server.js'>This</a>
            particular example implementation flushes
            object state snapshots to separate files (periodically) while streaming
            all operations to a single log file (in real time).
            <li><tt>Pipe</tt> is a connection to a remote Host backed by a standard
            node.js-compatible <a href='http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html'>Stream</a>.
            Pipes and Streams are mostly used internally.
            An average developer is supposed to simply use URIs.
            </ul>

            Here is a simple replica initialization example:
